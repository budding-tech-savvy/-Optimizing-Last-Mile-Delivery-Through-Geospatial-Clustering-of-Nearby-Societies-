# -Optimizing-Last-Mile-Delivery-Through-Geospatial-Clustering-of-Nearby-Societies-
Optimized the routing process for over 600 vehicles, reducing the vehicle count by 15%, which led to significant cost savings and improved delivery timelines. By implementing clustering techniques (DBSCAN), travel distances and fuel consumption were minimized, enhancing operational efficiency.
